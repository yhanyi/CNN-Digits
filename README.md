# CNN-Digits

https://yhanyi.github.io/cnn-digits/

A simple webapp importing a basic Tensorflow CNN I trained on the popular MNIST handwritten digits dataset with a 99.2% accuracy.

The models I trained before finding one with an accuracy above 99.15% can be found in this notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/yeohhanyi/quick-digits-recognizer.

The original project idea came from a video by Fireship which used Angular rather than React. As I wanted to learn React, I intended to learn both React and Tensorflow.js at the same time by building this project. In the end, I guess the hurdle was too high and I couldn't successfully complete the webapp without going learning React properly from the ground up. Maybe I'll come back to this sometime when I get better at React and TypeScript.
