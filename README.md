# CNN-Digits

https://yhanyi.github.io/CNN-Digits/

This is a simple webapp using a basic Tensorflow CNN I trained on the popular MNIST handwritten digits dataset with a 99.2% accuracy.

The models I trained before finding one with an accuracy above 99.15% can be found in this notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/yeohhanyi/quick-digits-recognizer.

The original project idea came from a video by Fireship which used Angular rather than React. As a result intended to learn React and Tensorflow.js at the same time by building this project using the React framework but I guess the hurdle was too high and I couldn't successfully implement my model in the program asynchronously. Maybe I'll come back to this sometime when I get better at React and TypeScript.
