# CNN-Digits

Simple webapp using a basic Tensorflow CNN I trained on the popular MNIST handwritten digits dataset with a 99.2% accuracy.

I intended to learn React and Tensorflow.js at the same time by building this project using the React framework but I guess the hurdle was too high and I couldn't successfully implement my model in the program asynchronously. Maybe I'll come back to this sometime when I get better at React and TypeScript.
